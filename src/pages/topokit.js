                <p id={'topoPar'}>Topo Kit is a Grasshopper plugin created to make topography design make more sense. By easily creating and modifying features in the landscape that help to define topography you can avoid the sticky problem of creating and recreating models with contour drawings. 

What should this tool be used for / what can this tool do? 
Topo Kit allows you to build great topography in Rhino and Grasshopper. This computational toolset…
It will change the game as to whether you are working in 2D vs 3D. That won’t be a question anymore. 
Set the grades of the features that you know and work out from there. Don’t start by drawing all of the contours first. Topo Kit will help you discover contours.</p>
